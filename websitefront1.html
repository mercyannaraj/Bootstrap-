          <div id="content1" class="content"><p>There isn't a specific temperature at which the sky is considered clear. Clear skies are defined by the lack of cloud cover, not by a specific temperature. A clear sky typically has less than 30% cloud cover, or none at all, according to Architectural Lighting Design Software. While temperature can influence cloud formation, it's not the sole factor determining whether a sky is clear. <br>
            <h5>Cloud Cover:</h5><p>Clear skies are defined by the amount of cloud cover, with clear skies having minimal or no clouds.</p> 
            <h5>Temperature and Cloud Formation:</h5><p>Temperature plays a role in cloud formation, but it's not the only factor. Humidity, atmospheric pressure, and the presence of condensation nuclei also contribute to cloud development.</p>
            <h5>Clear Skies and Cooling:</h5><br><p>Clear skies can lead to radiational cooling, where heat escapes the Earth's atmosphere, potentially causing lower temperatures. However, this cooling effect is a consequence of the lack of cloud cover, not the defining characteristic of a clear sky.</p> 
         </p></div>
          <div id="content2" class="content"><p>Rain falls when the temperature is above freezing (32°F or 0°C). The specific temperature at which rain starts is not fixed, but rather depends on the altitude and other factors affecting the formation and fall of precipitation.
            <h5>Freezing Point as the Threshold:</h5><p>Water freezes at 0°C (32°F), and rain is liquid water. Therefore, if the temperature at any altitude along the path of falling precipitation is below freezing, it will not fall as rain.</p>
            <h5>Layered Atmosphere:</h5><p>The atmosphere is layered, and the temperature at different altitudes can vary significantly. If a layer of warm air above the ground is present, snow falling through it can melt and become rain before it reaches the ground.</p>
            <h5>Influence of Altitude:</h5><p>The temperature at different altitudes plays a crucial role in determining the type of precipitation. If temperatures are above freezing in the upper atmosphere but below freezing at the surface, freezing rain or sleet can occur.</p> 
         </p></div>
          <div id="content3" class="content"><p>Mist is generally considered to form when the visibility is reduced to between 1 and 2 kilometers (approximately 1,000 and 2,000 meters) due to tiny water droplets suspended in the air. This happens when the difference between air temperature and dew point is 3°F (1.7°C) or less.
            <h5>Visibility:</h5><p>Mist reduces visibility compared to clear air, but not as much as fog. Fog reduces visibility to less than 1 kilometer, while mist visibility is between 1 and 2 kilometers.</p>
            <h5>Relative Humidity:</h5><p>Mist forms when the relative humidity is high, generally greater than 70%, according to Ambient Weather.</p> 
            <h5>Temperature:</h5><p>Mist forms when the difference between air temperature and dew point is small, as noted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (.gov). When the air temperature and dew point are close, there's a high level of moisture in the air, leading to the formation of tiny water droplets that create the mist.</p> 
          </p></div>
          <div id="content4" class="content"><p>Snow begins its journey high in the atmosphere where temperatures are extremely cold. It forms when water vapor undergoes deposition—a process where it changes directly from a gas to a solid—resulting in the creation of ice crystals. These ice crystals grow by sticking together to form snowflakes. Each snowflake is unique in shape and structure, influenced by humidity and temperature conditions within the clouds.
            <h5>Temperature Profile and Snow Survival:</h5><p>The ability of snow to reach the ground depends heavily on the vertical temperature profile of the atmosphere, If the entire air column from the cloud base to the surface remains at or below 32°F (0°C), the snowflakes will fall to the ground intact.However, if there is a warm layer (above freezing) somewhere in the middle, the snow may partially or fully melt, turning into rain, sleet, or freezing rain, depending on the exact temperature layers. </p>
            <h5>Melting and Precipitation Types</h5><p>Occurs if snowflakes melt completely in a warm layer before hitting the surface. If snow melts in a shallow warm layer and then refreezes before reaching the ground. If snow melts into rain in a warm layer and remains liquid until it hits a freezing surface, instantly forming a glaze of ice.</p>
            <h5>Factors Influencing Snowfall:</h5><p>Humidity: More moisture in the air leads to more snow production, as water vapor is essential for snowflake formation.Wind: Strong winds can transport snow, causing drifts or reducing visibility during a snowstorm (blizzard conditions).Altitude: Higher elevations are more likely to experience snow due to naturally colder temperatures.</p>
            <h5>Snow vs Other Wintry Precipitation:</h5><p>Snow is pure frozen precipitation with a crystalline structure.Sleet and freezing rain are mixtures or transformations due to temperature variations in the atmospheric column.The exact sequence of temperature layers determines the final form of precipitation at ground level.Snow typically forms in nimbostratus or cumulonimbus clouds, where strong updrafts and ample moisture are present. These clouds provide the necessary conditions for ice crystal formation and growth.</p>
