                <h1>ABOUT</h1>
                <p>Weather is the condition of the atmosphere at a particular place and time, including factors like temperature, humidity, wind, and precipitation. It changes frequently and can vary greatly from one region to another. While a sunny day can lift our spirits and encourage outdoor activities, sudden storms or extreme heat can disrupt daily life and even pose risks. Weather plays a vital role in agriculture, transportation, and health, and modern forecasting tools help us prepare for both pleasant days and severe conditions. Understanding weather patterns not only helps us plan our days better but also deepens our connection with the natural world.</p>
